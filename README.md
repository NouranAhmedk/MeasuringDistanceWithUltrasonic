# MeasuringDistanceWithUltrasonic
## Mini Project 4 In C 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - System Requirements
> - Implement the following system to measure the distance using ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 with the specifications listed below:


**1. Use ATmega32 Microcontroller with *frequency 8Mhz.***

**2. Measure the distance using the Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04. Check the *“HC-SR04 
Ultrasonic MT Student Tutorial”* pdf file to understand how to interface with this 
sensor.**

**3. The LCD should display the distance value like that:**

**4. The project should be design and implemented based on the layered architecture 
model as follow:**

**GPIO Driver Requirements**
> 1. Use the Same GPIO driver implemented in the course.

**ICU Driver Requirements**
> 1. Use the Same ICU driver implemented in the course.
> 2. The ICU should be configured with frequency F_CPU/8 and to detect the raising edge as the first edge.
> 3. ICU_init and ICU_setCallBack functions should be called inside the Ultrasonic_init function.

**LCD Driver Requirements**
> 1. Use 4x16 LCD.
> 2. Use the Same LCD driver implemented in the course with 8-bits data mode.
> 3. Connect the LCD control pins and 8-bits data pins as follow:
>  ```
>    RS → PB0
>    RW → Ground
>    E → PB1
>    Data Bus → all PORTA pins.
>  ```

**Ultrasonic Driver Requirements**
> 1. Implement a full ultrasonic Driver using ATmega32 ICU driver.
> 2. The ultrasonic driver has 3 functions:
>  - a. void Ultrasonic_init(void)
>    - Description
>        1. Initialize the ICU driver as required.
>        1. Setup the ICU call back function.
>        1. Setup the direction for the trigger pin as output pin through the GPIO driver.
>           - Inputs: None
>           - Return: None
>
>  - b. void Ultrasonic_Trigger(void)
>     - Description
>         1. Send the Trigger pulse to the ultrasonic.
>            - Inputs: None
>            - Return: None
>  - c. uint16 Ultrasonic_readDistance(void)
>     - Description
>         1. Send the trigger pulse by using Ultrasonic_Trigger function.
>         1. Start the measurements by the ICU from this moment.
>             - Inputs: None
>             - Return: The measured distance in Centimeter.
>   - d. void Ultrasonic_edgeProcessing(void)
>      - Description
>         1. This is the call back function called by the ICU driver.
>         1. This is used to calculate the high time (pulse time) generated by the ultrasonic sensor.
>            - Inputs: None
>            - Return: None
